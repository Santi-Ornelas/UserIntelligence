    "I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a \"croap\" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the \"Marco method\" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most \"feminine\" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",
    "OK IF YOU HATE SHAVING?!?! Get this , then go to YouTube look up how to use shaving soap. Watch several videos. Then break out your soap/cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try! If you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet.\n\nI hated shaving! My skin always got irritated and burned after! Then I tried this stuff after watching hours of videos, I broke down and gave it a whack. Now mind you I'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and I get worn out in my chair quickly!!!! After using this I look forward to shaving I can't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause I'm going to shave... I will spend the extra 10 min to get outta  bed to go through the procedure to shave ! My skin comes out so smooth and irritation free!!!!!! And the girlfriend really noticed a difference! Spend the money, spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting !!!",
    "First of all, let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff.  I gave this 3 stars because IMHO, it doesn't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes.  I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.  I did this and it does work well, but that makes it a 2-step process which I don't want to do.  I'd rather squeeze cream out of a tube directly on the brush, then do the lather in a shaving bowl.  And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",
    "I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.\n\nOverall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",
    "I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",
    "I don't have sensitive skin, but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better. I just completed my first shave and came away loving it. The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.\n\nOver all, 5 stars for value, ease of use, and quality of shave.",
    "I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.\n\nThe Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.\n\nAssociated gear: Parker 99R safety razor; Boker Tree Brand straight razor; Escali Badger Hair brush; Proraso Green pre-shave.",
    "Like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around. Its a larger amount than I expected. Ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps. They last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them. This one is very pleasant, very nice shave, lathers easily (I have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1-5 its a 2-1/2) and Im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation. I have a tough beard that grows in many directions and I would definitely recommend this soap.",
    "I have been using the Proraso shave cream with great success.  I purchased this \"Soap in the Bowl\" to support a recent vacation as I did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl.  This product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube, I did not experience any break-outs as a result.  This is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates.",
    "I have very sensitive skin.  Over the years I have tried many different things to help.  This is the second order of Proraso Shaving Soap I have made and I do not anticipate changing.  The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent.  This was good for me as I also don't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.  Although my skin hasn't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years.  I am very happy with this purchase.",

And for those asking if this is a hard puck or a cream, it's kind of in-between.  It's not as hard as a traditional bar of soap, but it's definitely not a cream.  It's definitely solid enough that you can take the product out of the bowl and hold it in your hand, put it back in the bowl, and you wouldn't need to wipe any residue off your hand.",
    "I've tried everything from premium designer stuff to the value stuff.  When it comes down to it, it's really just shaving soap.  This stuff is no different.  Proraso is a very good shaving product.  It doesn't have the variety of scents that other soaps/creams have, but for the price, it's a good low-frills product.  The soap is just hard enough to load my brush on it, but soft enough to get a really good load without too much effort.  It really whips up a great rich lather that is very slick.  It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and it works great with the Nivea aftershave balm.  The only gripe I have is the scent.  I don't particularly care for the soapy scent.  It's not bad, I just wouldn't wear it as a cologne.  Of course, smell is completely subjective.  Like most all soaps, the scent doesn't linger for more than a few minutes anyway.\n\nOverall, the soap performs great.  There's plenty of product in there to last more than a couple of months.  It performs as well as TOBS, but 25% less expensive.",
    "I was looking for a relatively inexpensive soap for ever day shaves. I like to save my artisan stock for special occasions and I am not made of money ya know. As a mass produced soap it's actually really nice. It loads well, though I will say it loads better on stiffer brushes than softer ones. The scent is nice and has some staying power. The slickness is about average I would say and it provides decent cushion. Is this the best soap in the world? Nope. Is this soap a decent proformer at a great price point? Absolutely. One of the advantages of this soap over the cream in a tube is that it has a better post shave. Not sure why but it is definitely more moisturizing and has a better finish than the tube creams from Proraso. This is their sensitive skin formula (and I have some sensitive skin.) Let me just say a preshave is a must. I use an oil but you could use theirs as well. A good preshave and prep will make this soap preform better. without a preshave treatment this soap is still to drying for me but it does have some good anti-inflammatory properties.",
    "I don't have sensitive skin, but opted for this over the green or red thinking that a sensitive skin product would feel all the better. I just completed my first shave and came away loving it. The thick/stiff cream in the container loaded up very easily into my brush after squeezing out excess water. A little goes a long way, I loaded the tip and was able to get coverage 3 times over my face and neck with a single load. A nice slick lather was produced - I have never felt a razor glide so effortlessly over my skin. After shaving i noticed that my skin started to tingle. It felt like menthol. This might bother some but I loved it.\n\nOver all, 5 stars for value, ease of use, and quality of shave.",
    "I had previously tried the Red Sandalwood soap and preshave, as well as the Green soap and preshave. I have used this white variety in conjunction with the green preshave (menthol and eucalyptus), as well as by itself. I found that it loads the shaving brush with lather as quickly as the other Proraso soaps, which is to say that you'll have all the soap you need in the brush within 30 seconds. Note that you will have to soak your shaving brush for a few minutes to make this happen. I found that blooming the soap was of limited utility, as this isn't a hard soap puck, but rather more like a stiff cream.\n\nThe Proraso white seems to have a thicker lather than the other varieties. It gives very good protection and nice skin feel after rinsing off. To me, it smells like tea tree oil. A somewhat sharp, almost citrus smell that is quite subdued and won't negatively interact with any other fragrance you wish to use as an aftershave. I have gotten the best performance with using this soap in conjunction with the Proraso Green pre-shave. I apply the pre-shave in a small quantity while the brush is soaking (just a few minutes), then lather the soap directly on top without rinsing. You may need to add a bit of water to the suds to get the right consistency as you go, but this stuff, when properly hydrated, is slick. All but the most aggressive shaving implements should work well with this stuff. I was able to do my first few straight razor shaves without cutting myself. With a safety razor and a good blade, the stubble comes off almost like magic. I was just able to perform my closest-ever shave with this tactic. Highly recommended.\n\nAssociated gear: Parker 99R safety razor; Boker Tree Brand straight razor; Escali Badger Hair brush; Proraso Green pre-shave.",
    "Like the smell and like most soaps it does not stick around. Its a larger amount than I expected. Ive been wet shaving for about two years and still find myself experimenting with different soaps. They last a long time so its not like you have a lot of them. This one is very pleasant, very nice shave, lathers easily (I have heard water but on a hardness scale of 1-5 its a 2-1/2) and Im looking forward to keeping it in my rotation. I have a tough beard that grows in many directions and I would definitely recommend this soap.",
    "I have been using the Proraso shave cream with great success.  I purchased this \"Soap in the Bowl\" to support a recent vacation as I did not want to travel with my ceramic bowl.  This product provided a very comparable lather and since it was the same ingredients as the cream in the tube, I did not experience any break-outs as a result.  This is a must have for travel or for anyone not wanting to mess with the separates.",
    "I have very sensitive skin.  Over the years I have tried many different things to help.  This is the second order of Proraso Shaving Soap I have made and I do not anticipate changing.  The product lasts a very long time and does not have an overwhelming scent.  This was good for me as I also don't do well with perfumes or lotions that have smells.  This shaving soap has a clean scent but very faint.  The most important thing is that this soap has improved my skin tremendously.  I use this shaving soap and switched to a DE razor.  Although my skin hasn't been perfect it has been a tremendous amount better using this combination than anything else I have tried through the years.  I am very happy with this purchase.",
    "I'm a woman in my 40s who has switched to shave soaps & a brush after years of canned foam. The Proraso green soap/croap is my favorite, and the white is very similar. Both are more of a \"croap\" (cross between hard cream & soap) rather than a straight up hard puck of soap. It lathers crazy easily with a wet badger or boar brush & the \"Marco method\" (if you're new to wet shaving or having trouble making lather, google it - you won't regret it), and provides a good, close, irritation-free shave. I lather in the plastic Proraso bowl directly on the soap, then go straight to leg. I have also done a separate bowl lather with this, and it worked nicely. After use I leave the lid off for a couple of hours to let the soap dry somewhat (I shave in the shower & store my soap there, so there's a lot of water) and then store it with the lid on. The white has a slight menthol feel, but considerably less than the green. In my opinion, the white has a light scent of roses & fresh cut grass. It's very light and clean, and I think it could be considered the most \"feminine\" between the green, red & white Proraso soaps. I had issues with irritation from the red Proraso (disappointing, since I loved the scent), but neither the green or the white cause any problems for me. Overall I am extremely pleased with this soap and it will definitely be in my regular rotation.",
    "OK IF YOU HATE SHAVING?!?! Get this , then go to YouTube look up how to use shaving soap. Watch several videos. Then break out your soap/cream and play around with it practice and then give it a try! If you do not find this to be thee best shave ever keep practicing cause your missing a step or have not gotten it down yet.\n\nI hated shaving! My skin always got irritated and burned after! Then I tried this stuff after watching hours of videos, I broke down and gave it a whack. Now mind you I'm in a wheel chair so it is harder for me to shave and I get worn out in my chair quickly!!!! After using this I look forward to shaving I can't wait for the stubble at 5pm or 5am to show up cause I'm going to shave... I will spend the extra 10 min to get outta  bed to go through the procedure to shave ! My skin comes out so smooth and irritation free!!!!!! And the girlfriend really noticed a difference! Spend the money, spend the time to learn , spend the time to treat your self to something fun and comforting !!!",
    "First of all, let me say that Proraso is good quality stuff.  I gave this 3 stars because IMHO, it doesn't work as well as the shave creams that come in the tubes.  I have a tube of Proraso, but wanted to try this, and the razor glides much better with the cream and I get a much better shave.  Also, from reading all the reviews and tips on how to use this soap, a lot of users are saying to swirl the brush directly in the container to start a lather, and then transfer to another bowl to complete the lather.

    "This is a fabulous product. It goes on smoothly and it dries perfectly under a UV light that is at least 36 watts. However, be careful because I made the mistake of trying to dry it under an 18 watt light, and while it dried, it starting splitting like regular nail polish a few days later. When I saw that, I was about to write it off until I saw an ad for the UV light I own; it said that it would not dry CND shellac because it was not powerful enough. After doing my own research, I discovered such was the case, so I bought a lamp that was over 36 watts. Lo and behold, it dries and stays perfectly!\n\nThe color is also beautiful, but you will need 2-3 coats to get it to stay on, and I recommend a dehydrator, bonder and base prior to applying it.

    "This stuff is AMAZING. I have thinning spots and this covers and binds to the hair. I used to always have to wear my hair up to cover it but i can wear my hair down now and not have to worry about my patches showing. It stays in place and doesn't wear off throughout the day. No more worries. I've been contemplating buying this stuff for awhile after reading someone's blog about thinning hair. I buy the smallest size of these, use it everyday (a little goes a long way) and it lasts me a month. I just reorder when I get low. So buy size accordingly to how much you need.  Get it you won't be disappointed. Get your confidence back!",

    "This might work well for others, but this brand made my scalp incredibly irritated.  Also, the color has a greenish tinge, which was NOT the look I was going for.  Nanogen and Cobuki have worked better for me.",
    "This worked for me! A little goes a long way too!  My bangs are thinning, so I use it right in front.  I would recommend it",

    "I like it work great on hair  make it look fuller great",
    "I did not see \"fibers\".  This is more like a colored, powdered hair \"shampoo\" that DOES add body, and does NOT leave white residue like a dry shampoo.  That said, I like this product.  I have fine, thin curly hair that will droop if I use heavy products.  I have tried a lot of body-building hair products, and many are just too weighty  Even Frizz-eeze is not great for me. So far, this is a winner..",
    "Good",
    "I got this in light brown.  I have slight hair loss from a medication I was taking, at my crown.  This looks like dirt, & sucks the shine from my hair wherever it falls.  The color is not even remotely brown or light brown.  More grayish black brown. I gave it 2 stars because I like the shake it on container.",
    "I like it but very expensive and other comparable products available.",

    "Great product!",
    "I since died my hair and it works well with dark brunettes for medium brunettes. This also worked well in my fianc hair which he is Asian with black hair so color is definitely darker than expected ( got medium brown ). It came on easy like pepper shaker and apply straight on problem area it sticks and stays until you shower or sweat . Covered his thinning hair very well ! If you touch it with a brush it will move it does not stick so style hair then put it on as final touches . Hope this helps\n\nupdate I bought a second one ! i love the mini because you can fit it in a clutch and don't have to worry about reapplying when you're out and about ! perfect for those wanting to make their hair look a little more full !",
    "After I had my baby, I lost a lot of hair (thanks, hormones) and had a few sparse spots that made me feel very self conscious. My hair dresser recommended this and I love it. It's slightly darker than my natural hair color, but it really doesn't seem to make a difference. A little goes a long way and makes the spartan parts of my hair look fuller and thicker. My hair has since grown back, but I have fine hair so I still use it in places. Love it!",
    "Husband loves it!",
    "Don't leave home without it!",
    "This product has changed my life... I feel so much confidence since I've had it. I was tired of people looking at the back of my balding head and the top. This adds hair fibers to existing hair. It covers everything on.my balding head. Sometimes it takes some time in the morning to do just like you have regular hair. You have to get a hang of the pepper shaker style. I have tried the other tools they offer, but as a primery bald person that just seems to not work as well. The pump just blows powder all over. Most people don't even notice there's a difference, and they think I just dyed my hair. I sleep with it at night and leave it on for almost about a week (5 days) then it starts to get a little itchy. Has to be touched up everyday. I.spray w hair spray n blow it w blower to hold. I have read that you can get it wet and when I go in the shower it doesn't seem to come out right away... but I haven't quite tested that theory out yet. Also cut it when trimming up like real hair. It's Worth the try for any guy n gal, n would be excellent for guys w fullet hair but thinning.",
    "This stuff is great. I have a frontal incline of my hairline and this product helps cover it up perfectly. Can't tell at all i have this in my hair and thats the way i like it. Highly recommend",
    "Quick fix for an uneven and terrible haircut! I received a very bad student haircut that went from medium full to shorter than military with exposed scalp. I stumbled across this stuff on Amazon and bought a competitors as well. This one worked well but was actually enhanced by the other one. This was mostly because the other was a shade different in color and combined created a more natural result. My hair was shorter in one side than the other and the student actually took a 'chunk' out. I looked terrible! This stuff actually created the illusion. Of an even look and concealed my visible scalp while my hair is growing back. It is worth a try! Hair spray makes it stick and once dry will not transfer. Step 1. Shake over your washed, dried, and styled, hair like you are sifting in a back and forth motion. Step 2. Pat gently but firmly into place. Step 3. Wipe any product off your forehead, ears, neck and be prepared to do it again. Step 4. Seal it with a mist of quality hair spray ( you do not need theirs!!). Paul Mitchell Freeze and Shine worked great!\n\nAllow to dry or hit it with the hair dryer!\nOnce dry feel free to shake your head over the sink to prove nothing is coming lose!\n\nYou're now good to go! Yes, your hair will feel a little more crunchy than normal,but for me I didn't care. This saved me from a lot of embarrassment and I recommend it to at least try. I don't think it will cover a bald head unless you want to look like you glued hair sprinkles on,\nBut if you still have hair, give it a go! Buy two shades and use them together!",
    "It's like sprinkling salt or pepper on your head and expecting it to look like hair...Don't bother purchasing.",
    "This is supposed to be \"light brown\" but there is way too much auburn or reddish color in it to be of much use. They should re-engineer the product to a more ashy color. LIght brown is just lighter than medium brown, so why all the red Toppik?",
    "Great product! I have extensive hair loss issues and this product has enabled me to go out with confidence.",
    "Great product. Bought it for my brother and the results were unreal and so natnral looking. I applied it for him. Might be better if you have someone apply it for you so the other person can see any bare spots.",
    "It always works for me",
    "This is the top of the lie in hair fibers.  I have to stay on a budget and use 2nd and 3rd best at times due to price.",
    "I really love this stuff. It stays put with hairspray. I have been using it for a while and will keep on buying it. But I noticed if I have lots of hair products on the scalp, it doesn't \"stick\" as well. So, be careful not to put too much product close to the scalp.",
    "My hair is catastrophically thin due to treatments of two cancers. Toppik does a terrific job at hiding the \"holes\" where my hair used to be. I no longer feel insecure about it. It is a terrific product.",
    "I use this regularly to hide the thinning hair at my part.  My scalp is ghostly white, and this somehow bonds to the hair (not the scalp) and fill in the part.  I finish it with regular hairspray.  I am a femal and have been using this product for years, and through many haircolor changes,  I've also used the auburn and light brown.  This is better than the cheaper products.",
    "Excellent product, it takes just a small amount to cover my thinning area",
    "It's a rather chalky, odd color. I bought it hoping to lighten up the Dark Brown which is really dark, almost black. It worked well as a blend but it's a weird color on it's own.",
    "Great product that lives up to its hype.  The small ones help you find your color.  (then can order a larger one).\nIt has a sprinkle method that I've used on both dry and wet hair.  I am a medium blonde with some brown tones.  The light brown was a good match.  It helps conceal a larger part or thinning areas of the hair.  The small ones are great for travel too.",
    "This really does disguise thinning hair.  I am a female with thin hair due to medication.  this keeps my part from looking too wide.  Looks normal/natural.",

    "This color is SEXY! Just when I thought I had enough pink polishes, Essie comes out with a beautiful hot  summery fuchsia and I am forced to get just one more.  While Bottle Service is part of Essies neon collection, I wouldnt classify it as neon because it isn't obnoxiously bright.  As with most neon polishes, this one dries matte, so youll need a top coat if you desire a glossy finish.  The formula is rich, easy to apply, with beautiful color pigmentation.  The color was fully opaque after two coats and has lasted a week now.  In regards to the actual color, I have very pale skin (no tan whatsoever) and this color looks fantastic on and doesnt wash me out like some bright colors do.",

    "I love Essie nail polish, but for some reason this one chips off very easily. Maybe it's the shimmer.",
    "it left the stain on my nails after removed...",
    "Pretty color -- sheer with a bit of shimmer.",
    "Meh. Doesn't last very long.",
    "Love the multi colored sparkles!",
    "I love this nail polish!  I apply one layer on top of a neutral color for a subtle but ever-so fun sparkly effect.",
    "As exppected.",
    "This polish is hard to get despite its popularity for the last 3/4 years. That is why a purchase two bottles in case this color will be discontinue (which I hope not). Its the real Essie polish. No problems with the delivery and the package was secure. Amazon did it once again.",
    "Seriously a beautiful color! A must-have for polish lovers, and especially nude polish lovers!",
    "Love this color.  Was looking for a great rich brown to go with my designs.  This is amazing...a deep undertone of an one blood red makes this more than your average brown.  Completely opaque in 2 thin coats, dries quickly and levels nicely.  Look AMAZING with a scattered Hlgraphic topcoat all on its own and a great base for nail art.",
    "New Favorite color!  A gorgeous charcoal color-I get comments on it every time I wear it!",
    "Essie is the best nail polish for me.  And I love the brush",
    "Mom likes it.",
    "The first time using this polish and it is very thick and does not go on evenly. Won't let me return and I'm very disappointed. I won't be buying polish off Amazon again. I usually love Essie.",
    "Essie nail polish usually impresses me, but this polish does not last more than a couple days. I would be very surprised if it was real Essie.",
    "I love this for my nails - I am able to fix my nails as well.",
    "Awesome color. The perfect dark blue.",
    "I can't stop using this!",
    "The brush is splayed out so i can't really use it. Just seems like cheap bristles or something?",
    "Great color!  I love it...too bad it's discontinued.",
    "Beautiful color for the summer!",
    "Love the color, perfect for summer. It's a little on the thin side, which I find is usual for Essie colors, but multiple coats leaves you with a solid, light coral color.",
    "Perfect nude color.  Goes on smoothly.  Dries pretty quickly.  Protects and lasts well.",
    "Beautiful true one coater polish! I purchased this after a review on JessFace90's youtube channel and I love it. It's really nice to use when working with nail vinyls as it is a true one coater.",
    "my favourite shade of red!",
    "I drooled over this color when it arrived! I bought it as favors for a bachelorette party and so did NOT want to give it away! It has a really pretty subtle shimmer."

    "Really like color but does have some glitter in it and I did not know it did... But looks pretty good!",
    "Amazing neon pink that stands out and screams \"look how awesome i am!\" Perfect neon with the amazing Essie quality",
    "This color is SEXY! Just when I thought I had enough pink polishes, Essie comes out with a beautiful hot  summery fuchsia and I am forced to get just one more.  While Bottle Service is part of Essies neon collection, I wouldnt classify it as neon because it isn't obnoxiously bright.  As with most neon polishes, this one dries matte, so youll need a top coat if you desire a glossy finish.  The formula is rich, easy to apply, with beautiful color pigmentation.  The color was fully opaque after two coats and has lasted a week now.  In regards to the actual color, I have very pale skin (no tan whatsoever) and this color looks fantastic on and doesnt wash me out like some bright colors do.",
    "Essie is a great polish brand. I've never had problems with the length of time it lasts. It doesn't chip easily either. This is a perfect color for winter, spring, or summer. Its simple and clean and looks great with a coat of glitter on top. I love it.",
    "Favorite color from Essie.  love the name to \"To buy or not to Buy?\"\nVery nice, and whatever you can say about nail polish.",
    "It is a little brighter than I expected it to be. But that is only a personal preference. Wish they had the same color but slightly softer",
    "This is a great colour - goes on a little darker than what it looks like in the bottle, but still a beautiful lavender.\n\nAnd of course Essie quality, so dries really fast without streaks. Needs at least 2 coats for it to be opaque though!",
    "This is a deep reddish-purple color, really lovely, and unusual.  Not sure what else to say, but need these extra words to post. :)",
    "This nail polish is the best! Yes, it is kind of expensive, but it does last and the colors are always fresh and beautiful.",
